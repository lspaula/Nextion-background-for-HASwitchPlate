# Nextion-background-for-HASwitchPlate

The HASwitchPlate developed by @aderusha has a blank background and I decided to develop a picture based background to make it more attractive. I know that HASwitchPlate uses 2.4' Nextion devices, but I have decided to go for 3.5' version of the display, which gives me more area, resulting in a better looking. For this work, I have used the Inkscape software to create the button/sliders images, which are also available and can be edited and modified as required by different panel configurations.
