# Nextion-background-for-HASwitchPlate

The HASwitchPlate developed by [@aderusha](https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate) has a blank background and I decided to develop a picture based background to make it more attractive. There are now both the 2.4" (with the original HASP pages) and the 3.5" (with a tailored to my system set of pages) display files available. I decided to use 3.5" version of the display, which gives me more area, resulting in a better looking. For this work, I have used the [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) software to create the button/sliders images, which are also available and can be edited and modified as required by different panel configurations.
